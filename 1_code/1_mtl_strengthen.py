# Introduction

"""
The multi-task model extended the RESNET convolutional base with three fully connected layers.
The model has two outputs with different network heads: one head is the classification output,
the other represents a demographic (age / gender etc.)

Loss functions:
A mean squared error loss together with a last layer linear mapping is used for the annotation-regression task.
For the binary classification task, again a cross-entropy loss and
sigmoid activation function of the nodes are used. The contribution of the different losses are equal.
The resulting loss values are summed and minimised during network training.
